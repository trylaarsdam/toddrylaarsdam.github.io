These links are either small side projects or interactive sites related to my projects from Windy City Lab. There are also some videos/images from productions I have worked on in the past.

# [ANL Gen 3 Mote](https://toddr.org/demos/anl-ar)
View the ANL gen 3 mote in 3D or AR. AR is compatible with modern iOS or Android releases, and the interactive 3D model works on all* platforms.
To view in AR, press the "View in AR" button, or the AR icon that appears. If no button appears, your device is not compatible.

# [GraphDash](https://graphs.toddr.org)
A simple website using IBM's Carbon Charts and Vue2 that allows users to open CSV files and view their contents as a bar or pie chart. 
All data is stored in your browser, and never sent to my servers. This was requested by a friend for use at their work as an easy way to
visualize CSV data.

# [Productions](https://toddr.org/demos/production)
A small portfolio of some of the more complex events and productions I have done either audio, lighting or camera work for.
