Hi, I'm Todd Rylaarsdam, a software developer focused on the Internet of Things.

I'm currently a sophomore at George Fox University studying computer science with a focus on digital electronics, and this summer I'll be working with Microsoft as a Software Engieering Intern.

In the summer of 2023 I worked with Mayo Clinic's Bioengineering Neurophysiology and Engineering Lab (BNEL), where I [created and deployed for patient use an embedded device capable of running seizure detection algorithms in real time](/projects/mayo-summer-2023), and I am continuing to work with Mayo as a contractor.

Previously I worked as a full-time embedded software development and hardware engineering intern for a year and a half at Windy City Lab.
