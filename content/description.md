Hi, I'm Todd Rylaarsdam, an embedded software developer.

I'm currently a student at George Fox University studying computer science.

This summer I'm working with the Mayo Clinic's BNEL lab as an embedded software intern. 

Previously I worked as an embedded software development and hardware engineering intern for a year and a half at Windy City Lab.
