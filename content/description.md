Hi, I'm Todd Rylaarsdam, an embedded software developer.

I'm currently a student at George Fox University studying computer science.

This summer I'm working with the Mayo Clinic's BNEL lab as an embedded software intern. 

Before that I worked as a embedded software development and hardware engineering intern for about a year and a half at Windy City Lab.
