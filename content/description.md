Hi, I'm Todd Rylaarsdam, a software developer focused on the internet of things.

I'm currently a sophomore at George Fox University studying computer science with a focus on digital electronics.

This past summer I worked with Mayo Clinic's Bioengineering Neurophysiology and Engineering Lab (BNEL), where I [created and deployed for patient use an embedded device capable of running seizure detection algorithms in real time](/projects/mayo-summer-2023).

Previously I worked as an embedded software development and hardware engineering intern for a year and a half at Windy City Lab.

You can find me and my work on [GitHub (@trylaarsdam)](https://github.com/trylaarsdam/), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/trylaarsdam/), and [Google Developers (@rylaarsdam)](https://g.dev/rylaarsdam).
