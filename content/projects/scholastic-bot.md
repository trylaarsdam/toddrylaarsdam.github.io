A discord bot that enables virtual scholastic bowl competitions. Created in the age of COVID, this bot keeps track of buzzes and manages players in a discord voice chat. 

The scholastic bowl bot lets schools host virtual scholastic bowl competitions. By simply inviting the bot to a discord server and creating a few roles and voice channels, teams can run competitions, play local scrimages, and also benefit from the various community features in discord.

To invite the bot to your server for free, go to [scholastic.toddr.org/invite](https://scholastic.toddr.org/invite). ***Note: I turned off the hosting for this website as the bot was no longer in use after 2021. If you want to use this bot, you'll need to host it yourself. Feel free to reach out with questions.***

To learn how to setup the bot, go to [scholastic.toddr.org/docs](https://scholastic.toddr.org/docs). It'll only take you a couple of minutes.

## Making this project

To make this bot, I used Discord.JS, a node package that allows you to create a discord bot/application. The web frontend is served using nginx and Express.JS and the entire application was running on a Heroku container. 

Overall, the basic funcitonality of the bot took about a week to make. The development was done at a brisk pace, since we wanted it to be done for the first scholastic bowl competition at my then high school. Since I'm no longer in high school, it's extremely unlikely that this will get any more updates, but the code is available on my GitHub if you want to view it or fork it [@trylaarsdam/ScholasticBowlBot](https://github.com/trylaarsdam/ScholasticBowlBot). If you end up using it, let me know and I'll make sure to not turn it off on you.
