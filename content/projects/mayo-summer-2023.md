I spent the summer of 2023 working as an undergraduate intern in neurology at Mayo Clinic. I worked with the Bioengineering Neurophysiology and Engineering Lab (BNEL) to create and deploy an embedded device capable of running seizure detection algorithms in real time. The device was deployed for patient use in the Mayo Clinic Epilepsy Monitoring Unit (EMU) and used to analyze intracranial EEG data being collected in real time from patients.

In addition, the device allowed multiple different EEG implants to interface with the at-edge Tiny-ML capable microcontroller, enabling 24/7 real-time seizure detection and forecasting for patients with epilepsy, whether they were in the hospital, at home, or off grid and disconnected from the internet.

My responsibilities at Mayo also included maintaining our existing backend infastructure, fixing bugs and adding features to our existing patient and physician-facing software, and creating new interfaces for physicians and research coordinators to view and interact with patient data.
