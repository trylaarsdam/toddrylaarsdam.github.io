I spent the summer of 2023 working as an undergraduate intern in neurology at Mayo Clinic. I worked with the Bioengineering Neurophysiology and Engineering Lab (BNEL) to create and deploy an embedded device capable of running seizure detection algorithms in real time. The device was deployed for patient use in the Mayo Clinic Epilepsy Monitoring Unit (EMU) and used to analyze intracranial EEG data being collected in real time from patients.
