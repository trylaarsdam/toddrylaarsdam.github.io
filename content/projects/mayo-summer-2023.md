I spent the summer of 2023 working as an undergraduate intern in neurology at Mayo Clinic. I worked with the Bioengineering Neurophysiology and Engineering Lab (BNEL) to create and deploy an embedded device capable of running seizure detection algorithms in real time. The device was deployed for patient use in the Mayo Clinic Epilepsy Monitoring Unit (EMU) and used to analyze intracranial EEG data being collected in real time from patients.

Picutred above is my demo to the entire staff of the lab I worked with of the working first viable product of this device. The system included playing back EEGs of seizures recorded from actual patients at Mayo through a signal generator, then doing some voltage division to match the voltage levels to those of the brain, and then sending those signals into the electrodes of the brain implant we were using. 

The physical device I built allowed multiple different EEG implants to interface with the at-edge Tiny-ML capable microcontroller, enabling 24/7 real-time seizure detection and forecasting for patients with epilepsy, whether they were in the hospital, at home, or off grid and disconnected from the internet.

My responsibilities at Mayo also included maintaining our existing backend infastructure, fixing bugs and adding features to our existing patient and physician-facing software, and creating new interfaces for physicians and research coordinators to view and interact with patient data.
