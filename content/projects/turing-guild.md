The Turing Guild is a group focused on teaching and mentoring high schoolers interested in computer science and
computer engineering. I was brought on to help build a custom learning management system (LMS) for the group
to fit their needs to function both synchronously via in-person courses, and asynchronously via purely online courses for their
unique courses that all contain computer hardware that the students build and program themselves.

The LMS supports features like user self-registration, multiple methods of course enrollment (e.g. a course code given
by an instructor who has pre-paid for courses or users enrolling and subscribing on their own), video and text-based
content viewers, and a custom-built quiz system that both allows for traditional quizzes as well as a friendly cohort-based competition for users taking the course asynchronously. 

The system also integrates with Discord, connecting users taking a course with other users in their same cohort, as well as with the instructors of the course. This allows for real-time help and support for users taking the course, as well as for instructors to be able to monitor the progress of their students and provide help when needed.

Turing Guild has already successfully used the LMS for multiple courses, including for in-person courses at Northwestern University's CTD program and the Dubai College, and for multiple online-only cohorts.
