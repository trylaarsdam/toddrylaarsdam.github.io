title: Estimate Terms
---

By accepting the terms of an estimate sent by Todd Rylaarsdam, the client agrees to pay the specified fees and rates for the work described in the estimate. Any additional work not covered in this estimate will incur additional charges, which will be discussed prior to the start of work. Payment terms may vary on a per-client basis but are typically net 30 days.

Any changes requested by the client to quantities, specifications, schedule, or other aspects of the services described in an estimate are not binding unless accepted by Todd Rylaarsdam in writing. Any requested changes may lead to additional charges, which the client agrees to pay when requesting and approving them.

Estimates sent by Todd Rylaarsdam are not guarantees. The price named in the estimate is an approximation of the project requirements as described by the client. The actual cost may change after all of the project elements have been negotiated and finalized. The client will be informed of any changes in cost in advance, and before any billable work on that task starts.
