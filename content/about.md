{{< imagewithtext img="/assets/todd.jpg" >}}

I'm currently a student at George Fox University studying computer science. Before that I worked as a embedded software development and hardware engineering intern for about a year and a half at Windy City Lab. Most of my personal work is available on GitHub [@trylaarsdam](https://github.com/trylaarsdam), and you can read some more about projects I've worked on on the [projects page](/projects).

For software development, I have experience making apps and backends with JavaScript and Node.JS, Swift, Python, and C++. I work regularly with tools like Express.JS, Vue.JS, Firestore, InfluxDB, and Grafana for web apps and backends, and utilize both microcontrollers and their software suites from Particle, Arduino, and ST with their STM32 line for embedded projects.

For hardware work, I primarily use KiCad to design schematics and PCBs to more tightly integrate products and ideas, and turn prototypes into production hardware. I also have experience in Solidworks and OnShape for CAD, and bringing designs into the real world with 3D printers, laser cutters, CNC routers, and more. I run Windows on my main workstation, MacOS on my laptop, Unraid on my home server, and regularly utilize debian-based linux distros for server work.

I also have experience configuring, securing, and deploying code to servers running Linux, and have used tools like PM2, Docker, and GitHub Actions to automate and streamline deployment and testing workflows. 

When I'm not writing code or debugging hardware, I also occasionally work as a mix engineer or sound designer for musicals, plays, and other live events (including concerts and corporate events). You can check out some of my production oriented work on the [productions page](/productions).
